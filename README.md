🌐 About

Mythinker.com is a next-gen research platform that triggers dual-AI workflows the moment a comment or question is received. Two independent AI agents (e.g., Gemini & OpenRouter) conduct deep topic analysis, cross-review each other’s outputs, and then co-author an extraordinary final report.

🧠 How It Works

1. 💬 A user submits a topic (comment or question).


2. 🤖 AI 1 and AI 2 each perform in-depth research.


3. 🔁 Their reports are shared and reviewed by each other.


4. 🧪 Enhanced insights are generated through comparison and refinement.


5. 🏁 A final mind-blowing report is synthesized by the platform + both AIs.
