## 🌐 About

Mythinker.com is a planned next-gen research platform that will trigger dual-AI workflows the moment a comment or question is received. Two independent AI agents (e.g., Gemini & OpenRouter) will conduct deep topic analysis, cross-review each other's outputs, and then co-author an extraordinary final report.

## 🧠 Planned Workflow

1. 💬 A user submits a topic (comment or question)
2. 🤖 AI 1 and AI 2 each perform in-depth research  
3. 🔁 Their reports are shared and reviewed by each other
4. 🧪 Enhanced insights are generated through comparison and refinement
5. 🏁 A final mind-blowing report is synthesized by the platform + both AIs

## 🛠 Planned Features

- ✅ Dual-AI research pipelines
- 🔄 Automated cross-comparison and enhancement  
- 📚 Final synthesis with platform-level logic
- 📥 Simple UI for users to input topics
- 🧩 Modular, extendable backend
